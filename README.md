## Outline 
A .pdf version of the syllabus is available [here](https://github.com/pzoch/QEcon2025/blob/main/syllabus_quant_website.pdf).


## How to start using Julia
Follow [these instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/julia). Please use at least Julia 1.10.0.

Once you completed all these steps press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>j</kbd> <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>o</kbd> in VS Code (alternatively press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd> to get the command palette and find the shortcut). This should start Julia REPL and you will see green `julia` text in the terminal. If you want to use Jupyter notebooks follow these steps: Input <kbd>]</kbd> (right square bracket) in the terminal. This should change text from green to blue (and you should see something like `1.10`). Type `add IJulia` and press <kbd>enter</kbd>. This will download a package that allows you to use Jupyter notebooks with Julia.

You can also see [here](https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started_julia/getting_started.html). You can skip 1.3.1 if you do not want to use Jupyter notebooks. 

## Git 
You can download Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win).

## Project management
See [this repo](https://github.com/jdingel/projecttemplate) by J. Dingel for good workflow practices.
